The purpose of this project is to give you practice designing a class/type hierarchy. 
It is important that you spend time designing your class hierarchy before you start coding. 
If you properly organize your classes and/or interfaces, you can achieve the desired program behavior below with significantly less code than with a poorly organized hierarchy.
